# Logo spacing
Spacing around the Simpology logo is dictated by the size of the logo that is used. There is a simple formula to calculate the spacing:
- First, consider the vertical length of the Simpology square icon as X.
	- Spacing above the square should be 0.5 X and spacing below the square should also be 0.5 X.
	- Spacing to the right and left of the logo should be i X.


# Typography rules
We use Poppins font, which is a freely available download from Google Fonts. Poppins can be used for all your customer communications, such as collateral and presentations. It is the font we use for our website, social media posts and other external-facing materials. When possible, use the individual Poppins varieties (e.g.
Poppins Light, Poppins Regular and Poppins Semibold). We discourage the use of software-specific formatting commands. For example, refrain from using the Bold
command in Microsoft PowerPoint. Instead, change to the Poppins Semibold font when requiring a stronger typeface. NOTE: We never use Poppins Bold. The strongest font face that we use is Poppins Semibold.

Type hierarchy is crucial to the Simpology brand. This page acts as a reference for how to clearly scale and showcase hierarchy.
- Subheading Poppins Regular 20px 140% LH
- H1 Heading Poppins Semibold 80px 100% LH
- Body Poppins Light 18px 140% LH
- Button Poppins Regular 20px 80% LH

Note: LH = Line Height, LS = Letter Spacing

# Using the logo on a white background
Choose the full-colour (black and pink) logo to place on or white background. In most instances, you will use the basic, full-colour, horizontally oriented logo.

# Colour rules
The graph on the right shows the importance of each colour. Simpology Pink and white are our primary colours while secondary are accent colours. Where possible, we prefer text to be in the colour Black #051313. This is a softer shade than solid black and easier on the eye.

Primary Colours:
- Simpology Pink: HEX E50F53
- White: HEX FFFFFF

Secondary Colours:
- Dark purple: HEX 8B1A83
- Dark blue: HEX 18364C
-  Light purple: HEX F2EEFA 
-  Light blue: HEX DFEBF2 

Tertiary Colours:
- Off white: HEX F5F5F5
- Black: HEX 05131B

# Backgrounds
These background designs can be used to enhance all communications. A light-coloured background can add an interesting contrast to a document or presentation. Use only the secondary colours we have noted in the Colour section of this guide. 

You can place a light-coloured block alongside a dark-coloured block, or one of the provided gradients or backgrounds for added impact.

# Mockup rules
We use simple outlines for our mockups to maintain a clean and timeless look. Device frames should be avoided, as they tend to become outdated quickly and can
distract from the core design. Here's an example of how layering can be used with these mockups:
-  You can place interface elements, such as buttons or modal windows, on separate layers to simulate interactions or highlight key features.
- This approach allows for greater flexibility and makes it easier to update individual components without having to recreate the entire mockup.
-  Use a full-screen layout with a high-contrast background to make the product stand out
